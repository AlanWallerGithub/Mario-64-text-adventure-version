    <div id="title">Dark World corridor</div>

    <div id="text">You enter this room and see a long passageway. At the other end, there is a painting. In the center of the room is a drop, you can fall into it. But at first it doesn’t even appear to be a drop. The painting, too, at first appears to be of someone. Then it’s someone else. As you look closely, it looks really as if there are two people. It’s a drop into another world, a world that is dark and you can’t see anything there, not enough seeing to tell things apart like people</div>

    <div id="title">Jolly Roger Lagoon room</div>

    <div id="text">Ah, a room full of aquariums. Are they filled with fish? Ding, ding! Yes. They’re filled with fish and the painting is filled with um, a painting of a ship, behind it is the sun, the sun is streaming in to the ship through a veil of water. The veil links the outside world to the inside world. You can see the outside and it smells of fish. You can see the inside and it smells of sun. A window of water, or maybe a frame of water that holds life, fish who know how to live there, they’re water-creatures, this world isn’t unknown to them, but to survive there they need special lungs which don’t allow them to live outside, outside of the frame of water which we look at, on the wall</div>

    <div id="title">Tiny Huge</div>

    <div id="text">Ah, a huge room with three spaces. One of which is a painting. The others are paintings, too. Hmm, I guess I could enter into one of them. Some are very far away, but it doesn’t look like it. Sometimes it takes a lot of time. It takes me a lot of time to get to these paintings. There is a space between these paintings. It’s bigger than it looks. A shoot grows from the worm’s head.</div>

    <div id="title">Room for Cool Cool</div>

    <div id="text">Ah, a painting of penguins! Or no, they’re snowmen. Three paintings, three levels of this room, like three little balconies. One leads to the other. Drop down later and later. Into an abyss below. A mother waits for her child, a body lets its head go up to it again, or rather the body waits for the head. The other way around. A head waits for its body. We can wait for hours. Wait for my baby!

        The first thing I notice upon entering this room is that it has three levels, so the room slopes down into three steps. One, two, three! There is a painting of a snowman. There are two snowmen! They’re together in the same painting. Oh, yeah. Deep into the painting, there is a penguin mom and its child. Yes! There are three penguins, or I mean um, paintings. Inside, there is also a snowman and its head, who have become lost from one another. It rolls down a cliff. The body rolls down towards the head. The head gets bigger as it rolls. *</div>

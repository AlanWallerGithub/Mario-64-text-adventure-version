    <div id="title">Main Hall the room</div>

    <div id="text">You enter into this room and it seems like a heart-shaped room. There are clouds on the walls, and a blue sky and mountains with green trees, painted on the walls. As a 2D surface. Up in the sky there is a sun. It shines straight onto you but only if you stand on top of a rose of the winds. Its spikes go in all directions. North, south, etc.</div>

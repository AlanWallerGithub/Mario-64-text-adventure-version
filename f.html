    <div id="title">Infinity Staircase</div>

    <div id="text">Ah, a staircase that grows out into infinity. It takes so long to take you up it! Sometimes it takes very little time. A painting at the top is of someone. It’s of someone you know. It goes on unto infinity. It takes a long time to course it.
        It seems as if you’ve already been in this space before. It was the space you just walked up before. It’s as if there’s an invisible wall in front of you. It blocks you from the future(ED: not sure).</div>

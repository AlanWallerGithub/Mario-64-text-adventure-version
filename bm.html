    <div id="title">Maze section of the castle</div>

    <div id="text">Upon entering this section, you notice your shoes get wet. The floor is flooded! It’s complicated and there are lots of places ot get lost in. Little bunnies hop around, with fur white. A painting of a flame is visible in the center. It’s surrounded by flames. It’s a painting of the pyramid that is hidden, pretending to be rocks on a wall. The rabbits are late.

        There is a painting of pyramids, hidden as rocks. Creatures the colour of light escape, they’re late! There is a painting of a fire hung up between two flames.</div>

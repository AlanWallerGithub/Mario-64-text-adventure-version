    <div id="title">Courtyard</div>

    <div id="text">On this courtyard, there is a huge fountain and it’s surrounded by ghosts. Splashing water! The ghosts have cages in them, or at least one of them does. Caged in! These cages house other houses. The fountain is round and has a central position. There is a star inside.

        There is a big star and real clouds and cages. It’s an outdoor space here and the sun shines on the star. Ghosts the colour of light are not in your sight at the moment. When you get close, you can’t see them. *</div>

    <div id="text">You enter and see two rooms. The ice is transparent. One room is a reflection of the other. When you look closer, it looks like you. But upon closer inspection it seems like someone else, just a reflection of you, a ghost of you, no one else at all, no one alive.
        A glass version of you. Like a snowman, you can mould its face with your hands. Glass is like a form of ice. Glassy, reflectant.</div>

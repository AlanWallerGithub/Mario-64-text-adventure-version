    <div id="title">Princess Chapel room</div>

    <div id="text">This room is very nice and small. In it there are paintings. Peach is praying! She’s got her hands on her chest! Protection. Her heart. It’s protected. It’s a small room because it seems to be like a small little religious space. Princess Peach is praying, or at least holding her hands. Her chest is being protected. The glass windows are colorful, but they hide a drop just behind them. If you fall down them, you fall down for a long time.
        It’s something beautiful.</div>

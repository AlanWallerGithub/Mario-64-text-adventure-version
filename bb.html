    <div id="title">Bob Omb Battlefield, the room</div>

    <div id="text">When you enter into this room, you see it is a very brightly lit room. There is a painting of a bomb on the wall. It’s marching bombs. When a bomb explodes, its insides come outside, boom! All of the fire it was storing inside comes outside. It explodes itself outward. I guess that’s why this room is so illuminated. It’s three bombs on the painting. Their heads are about to explode.</div>
